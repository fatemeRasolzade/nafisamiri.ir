        Hi, I'm Nafis.<br></br><br></br>I fell in love with the computer at the first
        sight when I was 7. I grow up playing video games. I love everything
        about it, not only playing them but also how they function works. This
        led me to follow my dream to make my own game one day. <br></br><br></br> I
        started learning c# and unity at the age of 15 and after that, I find my
        desire way In computers and decided to join the university to study
        computer engineering and gain more knowledge about an algorithm, data
        structure, software engineering, etc. <br></br><br></br>
        During my bachelor's degree, I became a teaching assistant for several
        courses and gave a lecture on C++ to freshmen. In the 6th semester, I
        joined at OPtime-Al company as a front-end developer. <br></br><br></br>
        During 1 year of collaborating with a UX designer, I find out about HCI
        and become interested in it. Recently I start studying HCI and UX design
        and read a paper in this area to gain more knowledge about it.
        <br></br><br></br>I am into Photography and recently decided to make a public
        Instagram page for my artwork.

        I fell in love with computers at first sight when I was only 7. Since
        then, my life, thoughts, and interests have all changed and evolved.
        After growing up, I was curious about discovering how computers work and
        how programs function in the desired way; I found an HTML and CSS book
        at home and I started learning. I can’t describe the excitement I had
        when I wrote my first web page at the age of 13. After that, my school
        awarded me a scholarship to participate in the national robotics
        competition and we were able to win second place. In my youth, I loved
        video games and was eager to create my own one day, so I learned C# and
        Unity at the age of 15. <br></br> <br></br>
        From Robotics, and programming using C#, I tried them all and enjoyed
        every bit of it, Then I got some vision of what I was looking for, so I
        decided to go to university and study computer engineering. In 2018 I
        entered Azad Karaj university.During my bachelor's degree, I was a
        member of the Computer Science Association and editor-in-chief of
        “Baziyana magazine” (Baziyana was a Game-centered journal. We used to
        write about the story of the games, their characterization, and design
        and analyze them from a technical point of view. We introduced the tools
        used and the systems required for the game.) <br></br>
        <br></br> Moreover, I became a teaching assistant for several courses
        and gave a lecture on C++ to freshmen. Duting my work at OPtime-ai
        componey, I colaborate with UX-designer and I Find out about HCI and
        become interested in. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In 2021 when I joined the Optime-AI company, I collaborate with UX
        design team. after a while, I find out about HCI from our Ux designer
        and became interested in. I currently start studying HCI and UX design
        to gain more knowledge about it.
